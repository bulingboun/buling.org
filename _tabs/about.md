Boğaziçi University Linguistics Society (BULING) was founded in 2020 by a few [linguistics](https://linguistics.bogazici.edu.tr) and [foreign language education](https://fled.bogazici.edu.tr) students in [Boğaziçi University]( https://bogazici.edu.tr). Today, we are a vibrant student club in Boğaziçi, organizing conferences, talks, trivia, game nights and much more all about linguistics. You can follow us on our social media accounts from the left sidebar.
