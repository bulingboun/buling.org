The old and very traditional Art & Solidarity Fest was organised by Boğaziçi's clubs that were mostly interested in arts. It hadn't been done in a very long time until 2025. This year, we participated in this fest with a "Most Creative Word" competition. Here's how the competition was organized:

The attendee comes in, sits down at the table. They choose a pre-prepared made-up word card or make up their own word.

They fill in these three fields:

1. The meaning of the word they just made up
2. Origin explanation (Can be logical or absurd)
3. An example sentence with the word in it

They write this word on paper in calligraphic or illustrated form. When finished, it is hung on the board wall, and the board transforms into a collective word gallery that grows throughout the day.

At the end of the day, a public voting is held for the “Most Creative Word.”
